Hi! 👋 I’m Wiktor.

You may recognize me from my work in the [OpenPGP][0] ecosystem, as specified by
[RFC 4880][1] and subsequent specifications.
I’ve contributed to ProtonMail’s [OpenPGP.js][2] as well as to the Android
[OpenKeychain][3].

In my spare time I’ve designed a [keybase-like system of social proofs][4] based
on OpenPGP which was later extended by the [Keyoxide][5] project.

Since 2020 [I’ve worked][6] on [Sequoia PGP][7] — a complete implementation of OpenPGP in Rust — and its satellite-projects.
My most significant contribution there was [adding new cryptographic backend based on OpenSSL][8].
This required tight collaboration with the [rust-openssl][9] crate maintainers, where I extended the crate with new features.
During that time I’ve also assisted communities in improving their OpenPGP
code, such as [migrating SecureDrop’s PGP backend from GnuPG to Sequoia][10],
creating Sequoia PGP wrapper code for [PHP][11] and [Python][12].

I co-authored the book 📚 [*“OpenPGP for application developers”*][13] and gave a presentation during
the [NGI webinar on future of OpenPGP][14].
I’ve received multiple grants from the 🇪🇺 [Next Generation Internet program][EU] thanks to substantial help from the [NLnet Foundation][NL]. The [latest one][SD] involves a close collaboration with [Arch Linux][AL]’s [David Runge][DR] 🙇‍♂️.

Outside the OpenPGP ecosystem, I was fortunate enough to be invited by
[arm][15] engineers to help maintain their 🦀 cryptography crates:
[PKCS #11][16] and [TPM ESAPI][17].
I’m also developing [several other crates][18].

Rust and cryptography are not the only things I’m involved in. I ❤️ open-source and
try to contribute wherever I can. Check my activity tab but note that
I’m not exclusively working on Github-hosted code. You can find more
projects I participate in on [Codeberg][19] and on [Gitlab][20].

I began working as a professional software engineer in 2007
and have since designed and implemented systems for the flight
certification of ✈️ civilian aircrafts, management software for 🔬
cancer research programs and dozens of other smaller yet engaging projects.
In my opinion, the domain of the customer is one of
the most interesting aspects of this work.

I hold a 🎓 MSc in Computer Science from [University of Technology in Szczecin][MSC].
